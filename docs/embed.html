    <section class="content">
Hey everybody!<br><br>The day is finally here! After almost a year of work, update 0.9 is out and ready to play! This is the largest update we've ever released and we're so proud of how it has turned out. Included in the update is a progression system, new unlockable weapons and equipment, randomized contract hunts, optional objectives, an in-game currency used to buy items, and more... <br><br>Many of you might have been expecting the anticipated Mothman hunt to be included in this update, however we believe that progression and replayability will significantly improve the experience of players in the Mothman hunt. Moving forward, we will be working on the Mothman as our top priority, while also providing on-going content updates through new equipment, challenges, new difficulties and other features. <br><br>There is a lot to talk about so we've included a detailed rundown of the biggest changes which you can find below. A full changelog can be found at the bottom.<br><br>We love to hear feedback on the game so if you find any bugs, or have some suggestions, let us know on our discord server: <a class="bb_link" href="https://discord.gg/B9u6pUA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/B9u6pUA</a><br><br><br>And as always, happy hunting!<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Changes</div><br><div class="bb_h3">The Fortress</div><br><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/36597407/c79800822e274264d4309db559009d4e0da5a58b.png"><br><br>Replacing the level select in the main menu screen will be a new playable area that acts as your home base and multiplayer lobby. Here you can invite your friends and prepare before heading into a hunt. The Fortress includes several stations to aid you in your hunts, such as the shop, personal storage and contract board. Completing contracts will earn you Silver and XP, which you can use to unlock and buy new weapons and equipment.<br><br>To get started in the fortress, head to the "Story Hunts" station and play either Night of the Wendigo or Bloodfang Forest.<br><br><div class="bb_h3">Contracts</div><br><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/36597407/741831e1ffbb275f1b5438ed5d1ed39e27030544.jpg"><br><br>The majority of the silver and XP you will earn as a hunter will come from completing contracts. Various cryptids have been spotted around the world and it is your job to take them down. Each aspect of a contract will be totally random. Contracts won't play out in Night of the Wendigo or Bloodfang Forest, but will instead take place in a totally new level introduced specifically for contracts; you won't know your way around just because you've played the story hunts. There will be additional random elements as well within each level. Cryptids will not spawn in the same location each time, they will prefer to roam different parts of the map, they will have specific hunting grounds and will have different hiding places; it's your job to track them down, and fulfil the contract. Loot and essential items will also be randomized every time you play, you'll have to explore your environment and use your Hunter Senses to find every secret.<br><br>Story hunts haven't been removed from the game however, they play an important part as you must complete the story hunts to unlock each contract. For example, before you can take on Wendigo contracts, you'll need to have completed Night of the Wendigo. This is because contracts will utilise similar cryptid behaviour and hunters should be familiar with each cryptid before they take on contracts. Contracts will not always include the same mechanics as the story hunts however, as they are intended to be much shorter levels with a focus on tracking and hunting the cryptid. The most major change that players will notice can be found in the Strigoi contracts, as contracts will not include the Crypt or the Elder Strigoi. The focus is instead on hunting down the three Strigoi through the forest. <br><br>Contracts will be very different to story hunts in one major way. That being the ability to bring in more equipment. Story hunts will start hunters with a rifle and some basic equipment to get them started. Contracts will not provide the hunter with anything to begin with, hunters must buy their own equipment. If you die in a contract, you will lose everything in your inventory. <br><br><div class="bb_h3">Progression</div><br><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/36597407/8d4886bcaa33c0f9611961c9a5ff7abc00c596b6.jpg"><br><br>Completing objectives in contracts will earn you XP and silver.

Hey everybody!<br><br>We've got another small update for you guys today. This one is focused on fixing bugs to do with the totems, as they were causing significant issues with AI navigation. However, we've also added a new feature that should make exploring and looting much easier.<br><br>Your Hunter Sense has been almost completely overhauled. On top of using it to find animal/cryptid tracks, you can now also use it to find interactable objects! Now it should be significantly easier to distinguish between environment props and items you can pick up. In order to balance this change, we've given Hunter Senses a much shorter range, massively decreased how much the player can hear, and darkened the environment when using Hunter Senses. <br><br>This is something we've been thinking about implementing for a long time, so let us know what you think. The system isn't fully implemented as of yet, so it will be fine-tuned as updates progress.<br><br><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/36597407/107c2fd6164d1ddb73c06ecda514094ba2249e93.png"><br><br><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/36597407/b328351216e91ec5a0cb622ae511c21c91c440c1.png"><br><br><div class="bb_h2">What we've been working on...</div><br>We'd also like to finally announce what we've been working on for the last few months, that being the progression system! We're almost ready to release it in update 0.9, and we can't wait for you guys to have fun with it. Included in 0.9 will be several randomised levels (random cryptid locations, loot, player spawns and more) in entirely new layouts in the styles of Night of the Wendigo and Bloodfang Forest. There will also be an entirely new area: the Hunter Fortress, which will act as your home base and lobby for multiplayer games.<br><br>There's much more we want to talk about that we'll be adding to Folklore Hunter in the progression update. We'll be making an announcement on steam talking about it in full soon, so watch out for that. <br><br>However, for now here's the changelog for 0.8.6.0:<br><br><div class="bb_h2">Changelog</div><br><div class="bb_h3">Changes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Hunter Sense visual overhaul<br></li><li>Interactable items will now glow when using Hunter Senses<br></li><li>Bloodfang Forest snow-cave entrance made much more obvious<br></li><li>Bloodfang Forest dynamite location made more obvious<br></li><li>Motion Blur and Bloom settings now cannot be changed unless in 'Custom' video preset mode<br></li><li>Removed the ladder from the Bloodfang Forest windmill</li></ul><br><div class="bb_h3">Bugfixes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fixed bug causing the Wendigo to get stuck on totems<br></li><li>The NOTW cabin door will now stop animating if the Wendigo is scared away<br></li><li>POV will no longer break when in ADS and sprinting<br></li><li>Several bugs fixed to do with Strigoi fleeing<br></li><li>'Item Added' notification will no longer display when stacking/splitting items<br></li><li>Placeable items no longer block crossbow bolts <br></li><li>Fixed bug causing wolves to get stuck on geometry<br></li><li>Fixed collision for many pieces of foliage in the NOTW ritual site<br></li><li>Fixed bug that mutes all audio permanently for clients if the host leaves during the ending text of a hunt</li></ul>

Hey everybody!<br><br>We've got another update for you guys which is unfortunately a little smaller than usual because this one is mainly designed to fix specific game-breaking bugs. However, we also thought we'd add some new animations for bandages and batteries.<br><br>Changing bandages and batteries into equipment rather than simple items has been something we've been meaning to do for a long time and felt that now was a good time to do it, since we were reworking that system anyway to fix the infinite crossbow ammo bug.<br><br>A lot of the bugfixes introduced here were completely unknown to us until they were reported by players, so if you see any bugs (no matter how small) or just small things you'd like changed, please let us know! You can post in the Steam forums or if you'd like faster responses, you can reach us by posting in the Liquid Donkey Games Discord server: <a class="bb_link" href="http://discord.gg/B9u6pUA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discord.gg/B9u6pUA</a><br><br>Here's the full changelog:<br><br><div class="bb_h2">Changelog</div><br><div class="bb_h3">Equipment Changes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Batteries and bandages can now be held in the hotbar<br></li><li>Item context menu removed.
