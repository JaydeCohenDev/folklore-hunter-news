Few return from that hunt. Gear up and trek out into dark forests, cavernous dens, abandoned military complexes, and more to track down mythical beasts of legends before they catch onto your scent. Once they sense you, even the best hunters succumb to their otherworldly presence.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Venture out on three major Story Hunts solo or with a group of supernatural stalkers to brave the Wendigo’s lair, investigate the vacant village now home to the vampiric Strigoi, and meet the Mothman eye-to-eye to face off in a battle of telepathic fortitude. Discover hidden secrets that lead to ancient practices meant to detain arcane monsters, and do what must be done to seal them away for the greater good…or free them forever. The choice is yours (so you <i>think</i>)!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Join the collective of hunters all suiting up for the chance to take on Mothman after years of training in Early Access with the full 1.0 launch now fully available. Customize personal loadouts with crucifixes, cameras, explosives, bear traps, batteries, and more to prepare for chaotic Contract Hunts where every pursuit presents randomized puzzle-filled environments to search.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">“The Wendigo and Strigoi encounters have grown in scope and mechanics since we launched in Early Access in 2020,” said Jayde Cohen, Founder and sole developer at Liquid Donkey Games. “The community’s requested this hunt for years now. I can’t wait for everyone to take down the Mothman in 1.0, or at least try to — it’s particularly devious compared to the first two hunts, and choosing to free it instead can lead to some unpredictable outcomes I hope you find amusing.”</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Folklore Hunter</i> tracks down distant rumblings of surreal monstrosities today on PC via <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/696220/Folklore_Hunter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\">Steam</a> for $17.99 as it launches into 1.0 out of Early Access with full Steam Workshop support for the community to create and share their own custom content and mods.

As a solo developer on a large 3D multiplayer project, shipping Folklore Hunter has demanded more than I ever imagined—code, design, environments, animation, networking—nearly everything you see in the game has been meticulously created by me and the team.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">That scope became overwhelming at times, and I chose to go heads-down to <b>push the game toward a healthy, finished 1.0</b> rather than ship small patches and constant updates. I’ve been too quiet for too long. That changes now.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><b>Folklore Hunter is not abandoned</b>—far from it. Work in 2024–2025 has moved the project forward, the finish line is in sight, and I’m targeting <b>1.0 in Q1 2026</b>. Here’s what to expect next and what’s in today’s build.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><div class=\"bb_h2\">What’s in today’s update</div><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This release upgrades the game to <b>Unreal Engine 5</b>, improves <b>netcode and client-side prediction</b> for smoother play at higher ping, adds a <b>new location ping system</b>, introduces the <b>Magnum</b>, and delivers UI/UX polish, performance gains, and world fixes requested by the community. Full notes are below.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img src=\"https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/36597407/9c7477ced32519e78cd20d4d8b65d90878e2f7b0.png\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img src=\"https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/36597407/f234bec1f95d65b370d3af454dd52521a471dc94.png\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img src=\"https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/36597407/493017ff0bf7d4270449290412ac167f5043e1dc.png\"></p><div class=\"bb_h2\">Version 0.9.1 Patch Notes</div><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><div class=\"bb_h3\">Highlights</div><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><b>Upgraded to Unreal Engine 5.</b></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><b>Improved netcode</b> for inventory management with <b>client-side prediction</b> and better responsiveness in high-ping environments.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><b>New location ping system</b>;
